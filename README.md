## Description

Raise Your Hand: your answer for everything. 

Raise Your Hand is a group-based Q&A platform for all-things code-related. Think of us as the Quora and StackOverflow for your next Study Group. 

## Background

Raise Your Hand was born out of a desire to ask questions and share answers collaboratively.  

## Features

- Analytics

## Usage

Users sign-up for our application by entering their unique username and password. After Login, Users navigate to a Group page and either: 1) request to join access to post questions and answers on a Group page, or 2) view trending topics within a Group forum. Once accepted into a Group by the Group Admin, Users can post questions and answers to trending topics. Group Admins can view statistics related to Group pages (for example, most popular and "trending" topics, Users with the most questions, Users with the most answers to questions, etc.).
